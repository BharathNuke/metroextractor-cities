=====================
![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/mapzen/metroextractor-cities.svg?style=svg)

This data is used to build the extracts found here: [Mapzen Metro Extracts](https://mapzen.com/metro-extracts).

Extracts are built weekly. If you submit a pull for a new extract, it will not be available until the weekly build has completed. This typically takes place over the weekend.

Description
-----------
* cities.json defines bounding boxes for various metro areas, which are used by [chef-metroextractor](https://github.com/mapzen/chef-metroextractor)
to produce weekly extracts.

Contributing
------------
You need to perform the following tasks for us to accept a pull request:

* update cities.json with your changes
  * do not modify cities.geojson; it will be generated automatically when your pull request is merged.
*  run the included tests, which will validate:
  * the syntax of the json
  * that the bounding boxes being sumbitted are valid
  * that the bounding boxes for cities all fall within their encompassing upper level bounding box (e.g. north_america)
  * that there's nothing other than a float provided for the bounding box coordinates
* the top/left/bottom/right bbox parameters should be carried out to the thousandths (three digits to the right of the decimal)

If you're unable to run the test suite locally, you can submit a pull request, but if the specs fail there will be a delay in getting your request resolved.

If in doubt, just submit an issue with your request rather than a pull request.

Running Tests
-------------
You will need to have a Ruby 2.x environment, then simply:

```
bundle install
bundle exec rake
```

Passing tests will look similar to the following:

```
